### Irregular Rectangle Image Cropper

In this repository, you can find my code that lets you open an image and select an irregular rectangle area to crop and save the cropped file. Cropped area shapes into a regular rectangle (possible rotations and deformations can be observed in cropped image).

Further explanations will be added


[Used 4 Point Transform](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/08/25/4-point-opencv-getperspective-transform-example/) to transform irregular rectangle shapes into rectangles.
